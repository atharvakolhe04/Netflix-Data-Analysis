# Netflix Titles Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the code and analysis for performing basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix Titles dataset. The project provides insights into various aspects of the Netflix catalog, including content type distribution, trends over time, popular genres, duration analysis, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is publicly available on Kaggle: [Netflix Titles Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). It contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of mid-2021. 

**Key Features of the Dataset:**
- Title of the content
- Type (Movie or TV Show)
- Date added to Netflix
- Release year
- Country of origin
- Duration
- Genres
- Cast and Directors
- Ratings

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas (Data manipulation and cleaning)
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data visualization)

## Project Highlights
1. **Content Type Analysis**:
   - Distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows.
   - Yearly trends in content addition.

2. **Genre Analysis**:
   - Identification of the most popular genres for movies and TV shows.

3. **Duration Analysis**:
   - Analysis of movie durations and TV show seasons.
   - Insights into the distribution of content duration.

4. **Geographic Analysis**:
   - Top countries contributing to Netflix's catalog for both movies and TV shows.

5. **Ratings Analysis**:
   - Distribution and popularity of different ratings.

6. **Cast and Director Analysis**:
   - Most frequent cast members and leading directors.
